1.a) This one is O(1) because no matter how many people are in the room, it will always only take one action to find a playmate.
1.b) This one would be O(n) because you perform exactly one action for each person in the room.
2) The function itself is O(1), but if you have multiple values, you'd have to do the function multiple times, making the process O(n), but the function still O(1).
3) The function is O(n^2), because we have nested loops.  For each input element, the function has to take n^2 actions.
4) The function is O(n), because we have to perform the multiplication function for every index/piece of data.
5) The function is O(n), because we have to perform the search on every item in the array.
